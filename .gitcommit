fix(): 
#
# As the project moves towards open source, it's important to
# switch to using standardized commit messages for everyone's 
# sanity.
# 
# Please use the following guidelines to format all your commit     
# messages:
# 
#     <type>(<scope>): <subject>
#     <BLANK LINE>
#     <body>
#     <BLANK LINE>
#     <footer>
# 
# Please note that:
#  - The HEADER is a single line of max. 50 characters that         
#    contains a succinct description of the change. It contains a   
#    type, an optional scope, and a subject
#       + <type> describes the kind of change that this commit is   
#                providing. Allowed types are:
#             * feat (feature)
#             * fix (bug fix)
#             * docs (documentation)
#             * style (formatting, missing semicolons, â€¦)
#             * refactor
#             * test (when adding missing tests)
#             * chore (maintain)
#       + <scope> can be anything specifying the place of the commit    
#                 change; often this will be the subsystem that it
#                 modifies.
#       + <subject> is a very short description of the change, in   
#                   the following format:
#             * no dot (.) at the end
#  - The BODY should include the motivation for the change and      
#    contrast this with previous behavior

#  - The FOOTER should contain any information about Breaking       
#    Changes and is also the place to reference issues that this  
#    commit resolves. Issues should be referenced in the form
#    #xxxx, such as #1234 for issue 1234.
#
# An example might be:
#
# ----
# fix(spawns): correct font metrics
#
# Previous font metric calculations were incorrect; this caused
# the calculation of screen size for a given spawn to be off
# slightly. Rewrite font metric calculation in order to correct 
# this.
#
# Resolves issue #2.
# ----
# 
# Hopefully this will help make a cleaner commit history for
# everyone to read. (And I need to adhere to it as well, going
# forward!)
