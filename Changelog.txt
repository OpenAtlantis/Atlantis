    - Made next/prev actions wrap around to top or bottom.

[2006/03/20] - Sparks
    - Lemuria 0.5.5.2: Redid text view using a Stupid Coding Trick.  Let's see if
      it improves the scroll speed for other people!
    - Changed input to support Unicode, and attempt to downsample to ASCII as best
      as possible.  This allows pasting stuff in from Word, et al.

      to do another release until 0.8.5.
    - Changed 'timer' events to also work as rate-limiters when put into ANDed
      condition lists.
    - Changed spawn weighting logic slightly.  (Only Paradigm should care about this.)

[2006/03/19] - Sparks
    - Fixed it so hostname is a clickable-to-edit field. *sigh*  Whups!
    - Added a 'Variable Matches Pattern' event condition.
    - Hooked up the 'any/all' logic on the event editor.  *sigh*

    - Fixed a bug where userconf variables could get lost.
    - Changed it so newly-created world events have their condition logic set to
      'all' instead of 'any.'  Most likely, people want all anyway, and this has
      bitten ME before, too.
    - Reworked a bunch of how the spawn config tab works.
    - Made Growl events actually remember their titles.  Whups!
    - Added the ability to detect network drops and reconnect when it comes back.
    - Added support for SimpleMU-style text-grabbing.

[2006/03/18] - Sparks
    - Added an 'auto open' option, to augment autoconnect.  Now you can have a world
      open on startup, but not actually connect.
    - Added 'options' capability to logfile base type.  This is how logs will get
      default option settings, info from the options panel, or info from a /log
      command down the road.
    - 'Open Log' panel now handles append/replace warnings in a more intelligible 
      manner.
    - Rearranged layout of address book buttons.

      editing the name of an existing spawn.
    - Fixed a bug where you could delete a world's name entirely, and crash the 
      address book.  Eek!
    - Added a 'Negate' condition to the events system, effectively giving you a 
      logical 'not.'
    - Changed Address Book to remember selected tab even when you move worlds.
    - Added new 'Timer' event condition, to do keepalives and so on.  Keep in mind
      that timers can be used even in combined conditions!  (Such as, 'Every 60 
      seconds if this is not the active world' or whatever.)
    - Added support for logfile types having options.
    - Added 'Open Log' and 'Close all Logs' events.
    - Added options to 'Formatted Text' logfile type (wordwrap on/off, etc.)    
    - Pretty About Box.
    - Released 0.8.4

[2006/03/17] - Sparks
    - Added stripes in Address Book world list, to make it easier to read, now that
      its cluttered with the connect indicators!
    - Fixed Display Name bug, also made display name work more intuitively.  
      (Character default display name is now Char@ParentDisplayName instead 
      of Char@ParentWorldName)

[2006/03/16] - Sparks
    - Fixed an issue with spawn editing, where if you deleted a spawn while you were
      editing the name, the edit message went into freed memory and KERBOOM!
    - When editing a spawn's priority with the stepper, it should properly keep
      that spawn selected.  Whups!
    - Made Atlantis automatically focus on the world when you connect manually
      from address book.
    - If there are no autoconnects, Atlantis automatically opens the address book
      on startup.
    - Added 'Close Current Window' action type.  Bind this to Command-W to get normal
      Mac OS X window closing!  (I've added that to the defaults.)
    - Lemuria 0.5.4
      + Views (spawns) now open in the most-active window if they don't have
        a window preference set.
      + Display classes now have an expand/collapse view list capability.
      + Fixed some activity indicator bugs.
    - Added 'Show/Hide Spawn List' action.
    - Fixed a bunch of dock menu bugs.
    - Next/Prev spawn actions are no longer blocked by placeholder views
      (i.e., 'folders').
    - When changing the selected world in address book, it automatically jumps to
      the first tab for sanity's sake.
    - Added the connection indicators and quick-connect clicker in Address Book,
      as per discussion with Thenomain.
    - Released 0.8.3.3

[2006/03/15] - Sparks
    - Fixed an issue with spawns and the pattern view getting out of sync.
    - Released 0.8.3 (build 24) -- I should probably just have done 0.8.3.1 :P
    - Fixed a bug where if Telnet IAC characters happened on a packet boundary,
      we missed them and Telnet negotiation broke.
    - Fixed a bug with world refresh, where parent world highlight and events
      could get lost.
    - Fixed a bug where gagged lines still triggered the activity notice.
    - Changed address book to refresh spawns and highlights if you change
      focus from it, not just when you close.
    - Lemuria 0.5.2
      + Fixes vanishing-spawn or crash bug if you dragged a placeholder (folder) 
        back to a window with a real spawn of that name.  Erk!
      + RDNestedOutline Lemuria display class should not get out of synch.
      + Made changes necessary to get rid of spawn folders by 0.8.4
      + Sub-views (spawns) now open in the same world as their parent where
        at all applicable, unless they were left in another window last time.
      + Fixed up responder chain so the X appears even if the outline view isn't
        the primary view.
    - Released 0.8.3.1
    - RE-fixed the bug where gagged lines still triggered the activity notice.  Sigh.
    - Evidently, PennMUSH doesn't like it if you send data before telnet negotiation.  
      So now, we wait until we've gotten at least one packet of Stuff from the server, 
      before we send the login/pass.
    - Lemuria 0.5.3
      + Outline view shouldn't jump-and-dance on creation of spawns anymore.
      + Lemuria will remember how you had the outline view portion of any window laid 
        out, so if it was hidden it will remain hidden on the next run.
      + Outline view properly displays a scrollbar if you have a ton of spawns. :P
    - Added 'Previous Spawn' and 'Next Spawn' actions, which move you up or down the
      list of worlds/spawns in a window.
    - Added 'Unseen Activity' menu to both the 'Windows' menu in the menubar,
      and to the application dock menu.
    - Found and fixed a MAJOR bug where the address book could lose your spawns and
      highlights, as a result of one change in 0.8.3.1.  Erk!  I am so sorry.
    - Released 0.8.3.2 as a result of previous bug.
    - Redid my Xcode project to let me set my versions in a single inspector, then
      have it automatically generate all my plists and whatnot, so that I don't have to
      keep changing stuff in four different places.  Now it also builds release images
      for me, and uploads them, when I mark something as ready for release.
    - Rewrote some of the socket class to remove six annoying (but harmless) warning
      messages.  Now Atlantis compiles warning-free!
    

[2006/03/14] - Sparks
    - Fixed 'Spawns' configuration tab so it won't crash on delete
      of a spawn you've got an editor field open for.

    - Fixed a bunch of address book commit quirks.
    - Released 0.8.1

    - Released 0.8.2 :P
    - Nailed a crash bug in Lemuria, now it's Lemuria 0.5.1, whee.
    - Added a Crash Reporter library.  Owie, pricy.  But the only one that
      seemed to work reliably on both PowerPC and Intel...
    - Added actions for gagging text from both world and from logfiles
    - Added action for opening the address book
    - Made child worlds inherit the spawns of their parent world
    - Reworked some of the 'flow' for creating spawns.

      in search menu.
    - Fixed bug where you could not truly remove character/password from
      a world.

[2006/03/13] - Sparks
    - Complete rewrite finished after very long time, whoot.
    - 0.8.0, initial preliminary limited beta
